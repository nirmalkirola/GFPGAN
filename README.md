# GFPGAN

### Introduction
A little convenient way to use GFPGAN. All the code is packed into a single file so you have to only import a function from the module.

GFPGAN aims at developing a Practical Algorithm for Real-world Face Restoration.
It leverages rich and diverse priors encapsulated in a pretrained face GAN (e.g., StyleGAN2) for blind face restoration.

This repository is the implementation of the original work done by [TencentARC | GFPGAN](https://github.com/TencentARC/GFPGAN)


## Environments

- python 3.8.8
- torch
